Hi! I am a third-year PhD student at [EPFL](www.epfl.ch) advised by Prof. [Daniel Kuhn](https://people.epfl.ch/daniel.kuhn). Prior to my doctoral journey, I studied math at EPFL, NYU Shanghai, and NYU Courant.

I am interested in understanding adaptive learning and stochastic control, motivated by applications in finance, healthcare, and sustainability.
