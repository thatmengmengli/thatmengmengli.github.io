Hi! I am a PhD student at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Daniel Kuhn](https://people.epfl.ch/daniel.kuhn). Prior to my doctoral journey, I received an M.Sc. degree in Mathematics from EPFL in 2021 and a B.Sc. degree in Honors Mathematics from NYU Shanghai in 2019.

My research focuses on developing statistically and computationally efficient methods for **sequential decision making**, inspired by applications in finance and healthcare. <a href="https://scholar.google.no/citations?user=CkOyq5kAAAAJ&hl=en" title="Google Scholar"><i class="ai ai-google-scholar"></i></a>
