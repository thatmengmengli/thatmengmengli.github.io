Hi! I am a PhD student at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Daniel Kuhn](https://people.epfl.ch/daniel.kuhn). Prior to my doctoral journey, I received an M.Sc. degree in Mathematics from EPFL in 2021 and a B.Sc. degree in Honors Mathematics from NYU Shanghai in 2019.

My research focuses on statistical and computational efficiency of **sequential decision making**, inspired by applications in finance and healthcare.
