Hi! I am a PhD student in Operations Research at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Daniel Kuhn](https://people.epfl.ch/daniel.kuhn). Prior to my doctoral journey, I received an M.Sc. degree in Mathematics from EPFL in 2021 and a B.Sc. degree in Honors Mathematics from NYU Shanghai in 2019.

I develop statistically and computationally efficient methods for **sequential decision making**, inspired by applications in automation and logistics. <a href="https://scholar.google.no/citations?user=CkOyq5kAAAAJ&hl=en" title="Google Scholar"><i class="ai ai-google-scholar"></i></a>

<!-- Maintainer note: If you see "load metadata for docker.io/library/ruby:slim" when starting the Jekyll Docker service, try one of the following:
  - Pin an explicit Ruby image tag in your Dockerfile/docker-compose (e.g. `ruby:3.2-slim`).
  - Run `docker pull ruby:3.2-slim` to diagnose; run `docker login` to raise Docker Hub quota.
  - Check network/DNS/proxy settings or use a registry mirror.
  - As a workaround, build/run the site locally (bundle install) instead of using Docker.
