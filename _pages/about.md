Hi! I am a PhD student at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch) advised by Prof. [Daniel Kuhn](https://people.epfl.ch/daniel.kuhn). Prior to my doctoral journey, I studied math at EPFL, NYU Shanghai, and NYU Courant.

My research interests lie broadly in the interplay of statistics and optimization. I am particularly interested in **sequential decision making**, motivated by applications in finance and healthcare.
